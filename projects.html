                        Lab Rats is a 2D shooter and rhythm game hybrid I helped developed in EECS 494 - Game Design. As a team of four, we designed the concept from scratch and underwent weeks of playtesting and rounds of bugfixing to polish the game. We kept detailed release notes on an indie game developing forums and showcased our game at the end of the semester.
